## Installation
Yet to figure it out.

## Usage
### Linux
Press "ctrl+g", release "g", and then press "c".
### Windows
Press "ctrl+g", release "g", and then press "c".

Press "command+g", release "g", and then press "c". - Needs to be tested. The
key-bindings file specifies "super" in place of command. Not sure if these are
equivalent.
